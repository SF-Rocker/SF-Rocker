- 👋 Hi, I’m TJ (known as Rocker)
- 👀 I’m interested in Linux system administration and automation
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Debian and Fedora server management
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to Linux configs and Raspberry Pi setups
- I have forked a Project, to show architechure support, because some did not have compatibility, and simply changed the architechure in Manjaro Arch on a Orange Pi 800, it was very interesting Project, since the Pi 800, I have been learning the Raspberry pi 5, and the Raspberry pi Zero 2W for basic computing with even headless setups and SSH.
